-- 1) What range of years for baseball games played does the provided database cover?

SELECT

	MAX(yearid) AS max_year
FROM teams AS t

-- A: 1871 to 2016; Teams and Appearances tables include the same range of dates and thus either can be included to find the answer.

-- 2) Find the name and height of the shortest player in the database. How many games did he play in? What is the name of the team for which he played?

-- A: Eddie Gaedel was the shortest player at 43 inches of height. He played 1 game with the St. Louis Browns.

-- 3) Find all players in the database who played at Vanderbilt University. Create a list showing each playerâ€™s first and last names as well as the total salary they earned in the major leagues. Sort this list in descending order by the total salary earned. Which Vanderbilt player earned the most money in the majors?

-- 4) Using the fielding table, group players into three groups based on their position: label players with position OF as "Outfield", those with position "SS", "1B", "2B", and "3B" as "Infield", and those with position "P" or "C" as "Battery". Determine the number of putouts made by each of these three groups in 2016.

-- 6) Find the player who had the most success stealing bases in 2016, where success is measured as the percentage of stolen base attempts which are successful. (A stolen base attempt results either in a stolen base or being caught stealing.) Consider only players who attempted at least 20 stolen bases.
